# Sign Language Recognition System
A machine learning-based project that detects and classifies hand gestures from sign language using a webcam feed.

A sign language Recognition System built with Python, OpenCV, and Mediapipe for real-time hand gesture recognition. This project identifies hand signs for 'A', 'B' , 'C' and 'VICTORY' in American Sign Language.

Features

Real-time hand gesture recognition using a webcam.
Utilizes Mediapipe for hand landmark detection and OpenCV for image processing.
Pre-trained model for classifying hand signs into 'A', 'B' , 'C' and 'VICTORY'.

Requirements

Python 3.7+
OpenCV
Mediapipe
scikit-learn (for the model)
